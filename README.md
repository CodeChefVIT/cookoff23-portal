## Get Started

There are two branches - test and typescript. The test branch hosts the portal in Javascript while the latter does it in Typescript.

To get started, fork your own copy and clone the brnach of your choice. To clone a branch you can run the following:

```bash
#Javascript hosted:
git clone -b test https://github.com/<Your username>/cookoff23-portal.git

#Typescript hosted
git clone -b typescript https://github.com/<Your username>/cookoff23-portal.git

```

Run these commands on your bash/terminal and open it in a code editor of your choice.
Please not that pull requests should only be made to these two branches and not the master branch.

Run the following to install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

To start your development server run:

```bash
npm run dev

```

To have the entire functionality please note that you will have to either create your own backend or fork the official backend of CookOff :

You will also need to host judge0 on your system. To learn more you can head over to their documentation[ https://github.com/judge0/judge0](https://github.com/judge0/judge0) .

You can also make a forked copy of the admin portal by heading over to: [ https://github.com/CodeChefVIT/cookoff23-admin](https://github.com/CodeChefVIT/cookoff23-admin)
